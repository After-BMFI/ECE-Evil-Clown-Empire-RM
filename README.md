One Final Note:
About ECE Tools
The developer, Jeff Rogers, has created many Ethical Hacking, Blue Team, and Educational Lab Testing tools under the ECE (Evil Clown Empire) project.
Due to the scope and volume of this work, many tools are currently stored across separate drives and environments.
As time allows, these tools will be systematically extracted, reviewed, updated, and consolidated into this GitHub repository.
Rather than delaying release indefinitely, the project will be built out progressively, with tools added and refined sooner rather than never.
